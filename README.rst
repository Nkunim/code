I like programming, love `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ and firmly believe in `Open Source <http://www.opensource.org/>`_!

Here I post some code mostly related to my work (or whatever I find useful) as well as the documentation on how to use it. Feel free to use and modify any of these. If you have questions or comments just send me a `message <fspaolo@gmail.com>`_.

**Note:** some times cracking scientific data formats can be a nightmare! So I started writing `this pages <https://gist.github.com/fspaolo>`_ in order to document the code and process I went through (mostly for myself).
