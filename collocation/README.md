Set of programs for calculating spatial covariances of the data,
and apply the Least Squares Collocation method 
for deriving the gravity field (i.e. free-air anomaly, geoid height, etc),
using heterogeneous observations from satellite altimetry and shipborne surveys.

Some Python code contains C++ code embedded in it for the performance-critical parts.

The core of the Least Squares Collocation approach is written in Fortran.
