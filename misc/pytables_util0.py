I agree that pytable lack a really simple interface. Say something that
dumps a dic to an hdf5 file, and vice-versa (althought hdf5 -> dic is a
bit harder as all the hdf5 types may not convert nicely to python types).

On my experiment I use this code to load the data:
'''

def load_h5(file_name):
    """ Loads an hdf5 file and returns a dict with the hdf5 data in it.
    """
    file = tables.openFile(file_name)
    out_dict = {}
    for key, value in file.leaves.iteritems():
        if isinstance(value, tables.UnImplemented):
            continue
        try:
            value = value.read()
            try:
                if isinstance(value, CharArray):
                    value = value.tolist()
            except Exception, inst:
                print "Couldn't convert %s to a list" % key
                print inst
            if len(value) == 1:
                value = value[0]
            out_dict[key[1:]] = value
        except Exception, inst:
            print "couldn't load %s" % key
            print inst
    file.close()
    return(out_dict)

It works well on our files, but our files are produced by code I wrote,
so they do not explore all the possibilities of hdf5.

Similarily I have some python code to dump a dic of arrays to an hdf5
file:
'''

def dic_to_h5(filename, dic):
    """ Saves all the arrays in a dictionary to an hdf5 file.
    """
    out_file = tables.openFile(filename, mode = "w")
    for key, value in dic.iteritems():
        if isinstance( value, ndarray):
           out_file.createArray('/', str(key), value)
    out_file.close()

'''
This code is not general enough to go in pytables, but if the list wants
to improve it a bit, then we could propose it for inclusion, or at least
put it on the cookbook.

As I said before, be used to recarrays. If you have reasons for sticking
with dictionaries, it is straighforward converting a dict into a
recarray. For example:
'''

>>> v1=numpy.random.rand(10,)
>>> v2=numpy.random.randint(10, size=10)
>>> mydict={'v1':v1,'v2':v2}

#Conversion to a recarray begins

>>> cols = [col for col in mydict.itervalues()]
>>> ratype = [(name, col.dtype) for (name, col) in mydict.iteritems()]
>>> ra=numpy.rec.fromarrays(cols, dtype=ratype)

# now, you can proceed to saving (and reading) the data

>>> tra3=f.createTable('/', 'ra3', ra)
>>> tra3[:]
array([(0.71896141583591389, 3), (0.6147395923362261, 8),
       (0.74390300993242819, 8), (0.85740583591803832, 8),
       (0.058988577053635471, 4), (0.33839332688847212, 9),
       (0.3847836118934358, 2), (0.0072535131033339972, 5),
       (0.42023038711482563, 5), (0.26398728887523382, 6)],
      dtype=[('v1', '<f8'), ('v2', '<i4')])

'''
Yeah, there are infinite possibilities in that regard. However, I think
that there is a beauty in keeping the values of a dictionary (or fields
in a recarray) tied together in a table. This approach has proven to be
very powerful in many situations (but, of course, the user has to decide
the better way to arrange his own data).
